# BF591-RShiny-App

**Post-mortem Huntington’s Disease prefrontal cortex compared with neurologically healthy controls**: This dataset profiled gene expression with RNASeq in post-mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from patients who died from Huntington’s Disease and age- and sex-matched neurologically healthy controls.

[[mRNA-Seq Expression profiling of human post-mortem BA9 brain tissue for Huntington’s Disease and neurologically normal individuals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64810)]

I engineered an R Shiny app for comprehensive molecular analysis of Huntington's Disease based on the above study, featuring sample exploration, differential expression analysis, correlation networks, and gene set enrichment, enabling direct comparisons with healthy cohorts.
